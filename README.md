# Number Guessing Game (CLI)

A simple, interactive Command Line Interface (CLI) game where the player tries to guess a secret number between 1 and 100. This project was built as part of the [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game) backend developer challenges.

## 🚀 Features
- **Difficulty Levels**: Choose between Easy (10 attempts), Medium (5 attempts), or Hard (3 attempts).
- **Session High Scores**: Tracks your best performance (fewest attempts) while the game is running.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Tells you if the secret number is higher or lower than your current guess.
- **Input Validation**: Handles non-numeric inputs gracefully without crashing.
- **Replayability**: Option to play multiple rounds without restarting the script.
